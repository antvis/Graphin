# MiniMap

> Note⚠️: Starting from graphin version 2.6.0, we have built this component from `@antv/graphin-components` into `@antv/graphin`, please refer to [release documentation](https://www.yuque .com/antv/gi/gstoyh)

MiniMap is a common interactive component that allows users to see where the content of the current canvas is located globally. Allows for quick preview and exploration on large graphs.
